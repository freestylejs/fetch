# Troubleshooting

This guide covers common errors you might encounter when using `create-freestyle-fetch` and how to resolve them.

## Common Errors

### 1. Spec Parsing Errors

> **Error:** `✗ Error parsing OpenAPI specification`

This occurs when the input file is not a valid OpenAPI document or cannot be read.

**Common Causes:**
- File does not exist at the specified path.
- Invalid YAML or JSON syntax (e.g., indentation issues, missing commas).
- Missing required OpenAPI fields like `openapi` version or `info` object.
- Broken `$ref` pointers to external files.

**Solution:**
- Check the file path and permissions.
- Validate your spec using an online validator or editor extension.
- Ensure you are using OpenAPI 3.0 or 3.1.

### 2. Schema Validation Errors

> **Error:** `✗ Invalid Schema`

This happens when a schema definition in your spec cannot be converted to a Zod schema.

**Common Causes:**
- Missing `type` field in a schema.
- Using unsupported features or formats.
- Invalid `$ref` paths within schemas.

**Solution:**
- Follow the suggestion provided in the error message.
- Ensure all schemas have a valid `type` (e.g., `string`, `object`).
- Check that referenced schemas exist in `components/schemas`.

### 3. Operation Validation Errors

> **Error:** `✗ Invalid Operation`

This indicates an issue with an API operation definition (path, method, parameters).

**Common Causes:**
- Query parameters defined without a schema.
- Missing `operationId` (though this usually results in a warning).
- Duplicate parameters.

**Solution:**
- Ensure all parameters have a `schema` defined.
- Add unique `operationId`s to all operations for better generated code.

### 4. Validation Warnings

> **Warning:** `⚠ Validation Warnings`

These are non-critical issues that don't stop generation but might affect the quality of the generated code.

**Common Warnings:**
- **Missing Operation ID:** The generator will create an ID based on the method and path, but it's recommended to provide explicit IDs.

## Debugging

If you're still having trouble, you can try:

1.  **Simplify the Spec:** Try generating from a minimal valid spec to rule out environment issues.
2.  **Check Version:** Ensure you are using the latest version of `create-freestyle-fetch`.
3.  **Verbose Output:** (Future feature) Run with `--verbose` for more details.

## Getting Help

If you encounter a bug or an error not listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/freestylejs/fetch/issues) on GitHub with your OpenAPI spec (or a minimal reproduction) and the error output.
